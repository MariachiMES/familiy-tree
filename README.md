# Caseload Generator

# Description

This is a front-end application written in vanilla javascript and using Skeleton CSS framework.

This application is written with the intention of automating the creation of simulated caseloads for ORR Emergency Influx case management. By entering a 9-digit starting A-number and the number of cases, and clicking on the 'Generate' button, the application will generate randomized cases on a rotating sponsor relationship basis for children ages 13-17. By clicking on a generated case, the user can get a view of the randomized data pertinent to that case. Each data point for every case will have been randomized with constraints which will determine the complexity of the case. The child's family tree will be generated, with birth certificates, identification cards, proof of address, letter of designation, and public records check. Additionally all data points including names, dates of birth, date of departure from home country, date of arrival, country of origin with regard to language correspond correctly. Some complications have been introduced at random to include expired Identification, falsified birth certificates (designated with 'generada desde la app'), long journey (over 30 days) and language barrier.

Lastly, the randomizer is able to export the manifest as it would appear in a real casework setting to an Excel worksheet once the cases have been generated.
